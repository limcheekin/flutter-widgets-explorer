# animate-icons

The animated icon will enhance user interaction with the app.
Unluckily, the built-in Flutter [AnimatedIcon](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/AnimatedIcon-class.html) class is too limited.

Thanks to [animate_icons](https://pub.dev/packages/animate_icons) package, it animates any two icons you preferred.

A picture is worth a thousand words:-

If you are interested to reuse the source code of the screen, please check out the `animate_icons` branch of the git repository hosted at https://github.com/limcheekin/flutter-widgets-explorer. Feel free to fork the repository and send me pull request.

I'd love to hear from you. :)
